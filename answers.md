The primary key is important because it is what will be referenced by other tables via their foriegn keys.

3: What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
A column that references another table's primary key is called a foriegn key.

4: What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
In order to have a many to many relationship we need to create a third, midway table that each of the others can access. Each table treats this third table as a one ot many relationship.
